Open source lab assignment.


The word “open source” refers to something users or people can use, modify and share since it is publicly available free of cost with uncontrolled accessibility

Open source software is the software with its source code being publically available for anyone to use, edit, inspect, modify, and distribute.

Programmers may use source code or may work to improvise an already existing source code by adding features to it, identifying and fixing bugs or enhancing it in some other form. image
